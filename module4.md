# Module 4: Assessment of Fitness Status
## _"How fit am I, really?"_

STUDY QUESTIONS **should be deleted; answers should be a mix of essay and Audio Visual Presentation**
1. **Do you need to improve your cardiovascular fitness level?**
    - Technically, I don't need to improve my cardiovascular fitness level as my Fitness Level is good for my age (23). My fitness level of 45 VO2 Max is of an average uner-20-year-old. However, I would like to "keep going." If I can't improve my heart's capacity to transport oxygen, then I at least want to maintain my heart's current capacity.
3. **Do you believe that females are more flexible than males?**
    - Honestly, yes, because women biologically have softer muscles than men. Although, it might seem the opposite because physically fit men seem to be more light on their feet than women, many men seem to be agile than women while women are more flexible than men.
4. **How many seconds did you do your push-ups and curl-ups?**
    - I couldn't complete the whole minute doing the push-ups, but I managed to do it for curl-ups. On the other hand, while I couldn't finish the whole 60 seconds for push-ups, I did manage to do 20 push-ups in 36 seconds. Based on the number of push-ups, I did _average_ for my age group, but I couldn't celebrate it because I didn't last for 60 seconds. For curl ups, I did 25 curl-ups in 60 seconds which is _below average_ so I'm not too happy about that either.
5. **Are you satisfied with your BMI and WHR results?**
    - actually, yes. My biggest concern is maintaining it, however, since my BMI is near the threshold for 'underweight' category. It is very easy for me to lose weight because of stress and lack of appetite because of food that I find unappeealing/that I do not like.

**Guide to activity**
- Choose one halth component you wish to understand your body with: Cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, muscular endurance, muscle strength, and body compositions.
- make a short AVP about the status of your body in relation to the health component you choose.
- relate your short term and long term goals into your body analysis you just made.
