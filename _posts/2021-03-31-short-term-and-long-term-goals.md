# Short Term and Long Term goals
***

## Concerns:
- fast resting heart rate and slow to lower heart rate (after rigorous activity such Harvard Step Test)

## Short term goals:
- Score average fitness index in Harvard Step Test
- Finish 1 minute doing push-ups
- Hold the planking position for longer (about 50-60 seconds)

## Long term goals:
- Maintain normal body weight/BMI
- Find a way to lower Resting Heart Rate
- Eat healthily or more regularly
- Flatten stomach area
- Build upper body strength

### Below are parts of my reflection essay that I chose to share on this blog. The complete version is accessible and available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-8Q-IdDKr5HOQIk4e9K8OHUXPpUfcN-1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> if you wish to read it.

> As someone who has always been physically thin, weak, shy, and lived most of their life in a sedentary lifestyle, I thought the results of my Pre-Assessment Test was more than I could hope for. Admittedly, I hoped I would perform better since I have been living a more physically active lifestyle for the past three years.... However, the results showed that I lacked upper body strength and stamina, based on my below average number of doing curl ups and average number of pushups (but I was still unable to endure one minute).

> I was happy, though, that my BMI reached ‘normal weight’ instead of ‘underweight’. I grew up as a thin child... I was a meat lover and did not eat enough vegetables. When I reached adulthood, I decided to introduce myself to vegetables. It was an opportune moment, as well, since I was starting to learn how to cook. Being interested in cooking means learning how to cook vegetables and nutritious meals as these are the recipes that require attention and creativity. I noticed that I gain weight when I eat vegetables and other food rich in fiber compared to my old diet consisting of only meat and rice.

> ... I fell ill multiple times for the past 8 months and each time, I lose the weight that I just regained while I try to endure, fight and recover the fever, cold, flu, or gastrointestinal illness, (or even fatigue and hormonal symptoms!) that I experience. I think I am used to having inconsistent weight as a result as my I let my weight seesaw every year.

> There are many other factors as to why I have a bad eating habit and lose appetite.... It saddens me sometimes because I have a positive relationship with food. I just lacked self-discipline is all. That is why, it is part of my long-term goals to maintain my normal weight. I believe monitoring my weight and food intake will also aid in catching the patterns of my eating habit as well as my mental health....
> 
> ... while I was confident with my flexibility, I was alarmed by what my heart rates showed. Perhaps I still have doubts... but it was still alarming that resting heart rates (taken first thing right after waking up) was between 68 to 74 BPM, with 72 as the more recurring number. If I understand it correctly, that is an undesirable number as a resting heart rate for a 23-year-old?

> ... (however,) I was not surprised; I was disappointed and ashamed, but not surprised. I have noticed before... that I was palpitating in the middle of the day even though I was not exerting myself physically – I was just sitting, looking at my phone.... I cut back my coffee and sugar consumption, my two biggest vices, for a while after that. The amount of coffee I drink now varies from day to day, depending on my mental state, but I can say that it is lesser now compared to last year.

> For my short-term goals, I listed the goals that I think is achievable within the near future. They are somewhat superficial goals that are focused on the number or times, rather than the holistic aspects of my health....
> 
> For my holistic goals, they are listed as my long-term goals because, for one, I believe they will not be easily achieved in a short period of time. And two, I think long-term goals are also goals that should be maintained and are not just milestones. Thirdly, I would like to find multiple ways and practices that will aid in achieving these goals over the years. I am not very confident that my current lifestyle – routine, health, environment or metaphorical climate, and others – will make it easy for me to achieve my goals, but I still want to work on achieving them.
