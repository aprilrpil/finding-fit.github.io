### 1. [The 7-week fitness program](https://www.ntnu.edu/cerg/regimen)

The 7-week fitness program from Cardiac Exercise Research Group (CERG) of NTNU – Norwegian University of Science and Technology. I found this physical fitness training source from clicking the links suggested in the Results after taking the World Fitness Level test from the last module.

### 3. [General Fitness Training](https://www.brianmac.co.uk/genfitness.htm)

Something more basic and classicclassic, taken from the Brain Mac Sports Coach. It suggests fitness training routines that are suitable for a common week's schedule, with the common office worker's lifestyle.


### 4. [How to design an effective exercise program](https://www.fitnesseducation.edu.au/blog/education/how-to-design-an-effective-exercise-program/)

An article from Australian Fitness Academy (AFA), which details the aspects recommended to be considered when designing an exercise program for anyone, even an average person. Not only does it ask for one to design the resistance training program carefully based on the evidence-based fitness design principles, it also reminds to consider the profile of the 'client' and to consider the environmental factors and conduct a needs analysis before delving into the exercise design variables. With these, an effective exercise program can be formulated for an average person as well.
