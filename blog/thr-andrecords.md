# Daily Heart Rates and Target Heart Rate

## Daily Heart Rates
#### Recorded from February 23 to 25, 2021
I have counted the pulse rate of my radial pulse for 3 consecutive mornings, as per the instructions given. I recorded my pulse rate when I woke up each day. I did not realize how alarmingly fast my resting heart rate was until I watched the tutorial on how to use the Karvonen method. The example given in the video was far lower than mine.

<table>
  <tr style="text-align: center;">
    <th>
    </th>
    <th>
      Day 1
    </th>
    <th>
      Day 2
    </th>
    <th>
      Day 3
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Heart Rate
    </th>
    <td>
      68 BPM
    </td>
    <td>
      72 BPM
    </td>
    <td>
      72 BPM
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Target Heart Rate
#### Using the Karvonen method

maxHR = "maximum Heart Rate"
RHR = "Resting Heart Rate"
intensity of exercise -> percent
```
maxHR of individual = 220-age

Formula: [(maxHR-RHR)xintensity] + RHR = Target Heart Rate

  {[(220-age)-RHR] x intensity} + RHR = Target Heart Rate
```

age = 23

RHR = my average heart rate is 73 BPM

intensity = I will follow the number given in the video
```
Target Heart Rate = {[(220-age)-RHR] x intensity} + RHR
                  = {[(220-23)-73] x 60%} + 73
                  = [(197-73) x 60%] + 73
                  = (124 x 60%) + 73
                  = 74.4 + 73
Target Heart Rate = 147.4 BPM

```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Target Heart Rate
    </th>
    <td>
      <strong>145.4 beats per minute (BPM)</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
