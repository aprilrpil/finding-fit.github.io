[Prologue: Pre-assessment Test](about.md) |
---------------------------------------------|
The first thing that we did in PE1 (aside from introducing ourselves) was to take a pre-assessment test to see the physical state our bodies were currently at, at the time (late February 2021). I have shared some of my results on my About Me page.|

[Daily Heart Rates and Target Heart Rate](thr-andrecords.md) |
---------------------------------------------|
Resting heart rates recorded in 3 consecutive days, Feb 23 to 25, before taking the Pre-assessment Test, and my Target Heart Rate (THR), calculated using the Karvonen Method, based on my resting heart rate recorded on March 15. |

[Short Term and Long Term goals](goals.md) |

My short term and long term goals. The link to view my reflection paper is included there as well. |

[Module 4: Assessment of Fitness Status](module4.md) |
---------------------------------------------|
How fit am I, really? After taking test to see the fitness level of my cardiovascular health in worldfitnesslevel.org, I try to analyze the fitness status of my body and what health component I should focus on from now on. |

[Principles in Fitness Training Design](module5.md) |
---------------------------------------------|
There are variables and principles needed in creating an effective fitness program. An effective fitness training program or resistance training program is a dynamic program that is flexible and can change based on the individual's needs, ability, and progression.|
