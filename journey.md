# My Journey to Finding Fit

[Prologue: Pre-assessment Test](about.md) |
---------------------------------------------|
The first thing that we did in PE1 (aside from introducing ourselves) was to take a pre-assessment test to see the physical state our bodies were currently at, at the time (late February 2021). I have shared some of my results on my About Me page.|

[Daily Heart Rates and Target Heart Rate](thr-andrecords.md) |
---------------------------------------------|
Resting heart rates recorded in 3 consecutive days, Feb 23 to 25, before taking the Pre-assessment Test, and my Target Heart Rate (THR), calculated using the Karvonen Method, based on my resting heart rate recorded on March 15. |
