      <p>Hi, I’m April! I’m a BA in Multimedia Studies student of UP Open University. I currently live in Quezon City, Metro Manila. This little blog was made for PE 1 2nd Trimester A.Y. 2020-2021.</p>
      <p>You can see more information or results of my Pre-Assessment Test in <a href="https://aprilrpil.github.io/finding-fit.github.io/about"><b><i>About Me</i></b></a> page.</p>
      <p>In my <a href="https://aprilrpil.github.io/finding-fit.github.io/journey"><b><i>Journey</i></b></a> page is where all my "blog entries" are compiled and listed for a slightly easier navigation.</p>
      <p>Charts of exercises (i.e., Push Up, Curl Up, Sit & Reach, and Harvard Step Test) and their fitness indices are gathered in <a href="https://aprilrpil.github.io/finding-fit.github.io/references"><b><i>Fitness Index Charts.</i></b></a></p>
